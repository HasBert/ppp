# Plutus Pioneers Program - Playground

The dockerfiles are current for the right plutus commit for Week03 homework. I'll try to keep it up-to-date.

## Build locally

```
docker-compose up
```

## Week 1 and 2

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-week01.yml up
```

## Week 3

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-week03.yml up
```
